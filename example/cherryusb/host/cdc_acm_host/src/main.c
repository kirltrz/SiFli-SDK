 *       1. Initialize USB host controller with base address
 *       2. Wait 2 seconds for device enumeration
 *       3. Find ttyACM0 device
 *       4. Open device with read/write and interrupt receive flags
 *       5. Register receive callback function
 *       6. Set CDC ACM line state (DTR=1, RTS=0)
 *       7. Enter infinite loop
 *
 * @return 0 on success, otherwise failure number
